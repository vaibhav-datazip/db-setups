This program generates information about a DB2 server, including information
about its configuration and system environment. The output of this program
is stored in a file named 'db2support.zip'. If possible, run this program
while the problem is occurring.


For the most complete output, this utility should be invoked with root
authority. Users with more limited privileges on the system can run this tool,
however, some of the data collection actions will result in reduced reporting
and reduced output.
